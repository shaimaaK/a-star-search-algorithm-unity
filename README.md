# Path Finding Algorithm : A Star Algorithm 
This project is implemented as part of the Robotics Course in my masters degree. The project simulates the shortest path problem in the setting of a maze where several 
issues of mobile robots encounters:
1. Obstacle Avoidance
2. Find the path leading out of the maze
3. Finding the shortest route
